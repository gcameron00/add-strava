# Workouts — a Strava dashboard mini-site

A small personal mini-site that turns [Strava](https://www.strava.com) activity
into an at-a-glance training dashboard. Lives at `workouts.gcameron.com`.

Built as **static HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript — no framework, no build
step** — and hosted on **Cloudflare Pages**. The live Strava integration runs
on a **Cloudflare Pages Function** so that API tokens never reach the browser.

> **Status:** live. The dashboard, activities feed and gear list are powered by
> real Strava data via a Cloudflare Pages Function. See
> [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for how it's
> wired up; future ideas are in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Features

- **Dashboard** (`/`) — the homepage:
  - Most recent activity (Today / Yesterday / N days ago) and what it was
  - Most recent activity **per sport**
  - Running progress vs **weekly / monthly / yearly** goals
  - **Key metrics per activity type** (distance, time, elevation, avg HR)
  - **Gear warnings** — shoes approaching their replacement mileage
- **Activities** (`/activities/`) — year-to-date totals per sport and a
  filterable activity feed.
- **Gear** (`/gear/`) — shoes and bikes tracked on Strava, with wear bars.
- **Restricted** (`/restricted/`) — deeper metrics, deep links into Strava,
  and [`/restricted/settings/`](restricted/settings/index.html) for goals +
  gear retirement config.
- **About** (`/about/`) — what the site is and how it's built.
- Light/dark theming with a manual toggle, responsive layout, keyboard-
  accessible navigation.
- The whole site sits behind **Cloudflare Zero Trust Access** — nothing here
  is public.

## How the data layer works

Every page renders from a single global object, `window.WORKOUTS_DATA`. Each
page loads [`assets/js/data.js`](assets/js/data.js), which fetches
`/api/summary` from the Cloudflare Pages Function (see [`functions/`](functions/))
and, once the data lands, loads that page's render script — named via the
`data-render` attribute on the `data.js` `<script>` tag (`dashboard.js`,
`activities.js` or `gear.js`). If the fetch fails, `data.js` shows an error
banner instead and the render script is never loaded, so those files never
have to handle missing data themselves.

[`assets/js/mock-data.js`](assets/js/mock-data.js) mirrors the Strava API shape
and is kept around for offline UI work — point a page's script tag at it
instead of `data.js` if you want to preview layout changes without a live
backend.

## Local preview

No build step — serve the folder with any static server:

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8080

# or Node
npx serve .
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>. Root-absolute paths (`/assets/...`,
`/about/`) work when served from the project root.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

1. Connect this repository to a new Cloudflare Pages project.
2. Framework preset: **None**. Build command: *(empty)*. Output directory: `/`
   (the repo root is already the site root).
3. Add your custom domain, e.g. `workouts.mysite.com`.
4. Protect the whole site with a **Zero Trust Access** application for
   `workouts.mysite.com/*` (a single site-wide policy, rather than gating
   just `/restricted*`).

Full details, including the Worker + Strava OAuth setup, are in
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

## Notes on data & privacy

The whole site sits behind Cloudflare Zero Trust Access — there's no public
page. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Strava; use of the
Strava API is subject to the
[Strava API Agreement](https://www.strava.com/legal/api).
